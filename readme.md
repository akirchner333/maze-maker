# Maze Maker
Maze Maker is a little site that generates mazes using [recursive backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_depth-first_search). Users can specify a width, length, and random seed for the maze. Each maze uses seeded randomness, so you can share the maze just by using the url of the page it's on.
